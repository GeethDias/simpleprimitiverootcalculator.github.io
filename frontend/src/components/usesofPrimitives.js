            <h2>Uses of Primitive Roots</h2>
            <p>
                Primitive roots play an important role in various fields of mathematics and computer science.
                They are particularly useful in areas that involve modular arithmetic. Here are some common
                applications

                    <strong>Cryptography:</strong> Primitive roots are used in cryptographic algorithms like the
                    Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the ElGamal encryption system to securely share keys between
                    parties.

                <p>Why Any Value Cannot Be a Primitive Root in Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange?
                    In the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, a primitive root is a critical component because it ensures the security and proper functioning of the algorithm.

                    A primitive root of a prime number
                    ùëù
                    p is a number
                    ùëî
                    g such that the powers of
                    ùëî
                    g modulo
                    ùëù
                    p generate all integers from
                    1
                    1 to
                    ùëù
                    ‚àí
                    1
                    p‚àí1. If
                    ùëî
                    g is not a primitive root, the resulting values will not cover the entire range, reducing the possible keys and making the system more predictable and less secure.

                    This property is essential because the security of Diffie-Hellman relies on the difficulty of solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem. Choosing a number that is not a primitive root compromises this difficulty, potentially exposing the system to attacks.

                    To ensure maximum security,
                    ùëî
                    g must be carefully chosen as a valid primitive root of the prime number
                    ùëù
                    p, making it impossible to predict shared keys or compromise the confidentiality of communications.</p>
